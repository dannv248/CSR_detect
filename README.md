Using Software To Extract The Information About CSR-related Objectives

Interesting in the relationship between the CSR activities and corporate performance, I implement this research to answer the research question:
+ Whether granting executives CSR-contingent compensation lead to an improvement in Corporate Performance results?

Several contributions and implications of this research: 
+ The result will be useful for boards and policymakers in designing CSR-contingent compensation contracts in terms of when to use CSR contracts.
+ Explain the impact of CSR factors on the performance of companies.
+ Contributes to the burgeoning literature on the CSR research literature.

Methodology
+ Examine the Proxy Statements filed to U.S. SEC for the fiscal years 1998â€“2019
+ In carefully going through these statements, I will note whether any portion of executives' compensation was tied to "safety", "environment", "customer satisfaction", "social responsibility", and/or other variables related to corporate social responsibility
+ Instead of using manual checking, I will use software (STATA) to detect the keywords.

Source of data: 
+ Incentive Lab data: executive compensation data
+ Compustat data: firm level data
